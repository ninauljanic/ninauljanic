### Hi there 👋

My name is Nina Uljanić and I'm a software engineer! I graduated from University of Gothenburg in 2019 with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and Management. After graduation I have worked as a back-end developer, writing code in Kotlin, Java, Groovy and Python. Besides programming, my interests lie in mathematics and physics, which I am hoping to combine into my professional life. I am planning to attain a MSc in Engineering Physics with the goal of learning more about quantum information theory and quantum computing.

- 🔭 I’m working on a chess implementation in Java, which I am planning to (re)use in my VR Chess project. I sometimes play chess in my free time and I thought these two projects would be a fun way of improving my coding skills. This is unfortunately going slowly due to the fact that I am working full time and studying 75%.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about computer networks through a distance course, and any additional free time I dedicate to studying linear algebra.
- ⚡ In my free time I enjoy playing video games, reading books, and lifting weights!
